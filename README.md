# democonstructionkit

A Go/Ebitengine construction kit extracted from the actual productions in `demos/`.
The shared code must preserve their original artwork, text, lookup tables, timing,
pixel rounding, source crops, drawing order and blend operations.

**The first gallery was not a faithful reconstruction.** It has been moved to
`cmd/studies`. The current gallery launches the original applications after their
shared rendering components have been migrated to this module.

## Try the corrected work

From `lib/democonstructionkit`:

```sh
# Original productions using the shared kit; original sound/controls are retained.
go run ./cmd/gallery -demo bilizir-demo
go run ./cmd/gallery -demo viva_tcb
go run ./cmd/gallery -demo megatwist
go run ./cmd/gallery -demo go-multiscreen

# One configurable scroller: mixed fonts, speed/pause/shape/color controls,
# raster bands and independently positioned logos.
go run ./examples/composer

# Compare an actual migrated production with its pinned original Git revision.
go run ./cmd/fidelity -demo bilizir-demo
```

`-demos /path/to/demos` selects another checkout. `gallery -list` lists productions.
The launcher runs the migrated source application; it does not replace its scene
script with a kit-generated approximation. Each source repository has a local
`go.mod` replacement pointing back to this module.

## One scrolling pipeline

```go
scroll, err := scrolling.New(scrolling.Config{
    Fonts: map[string]scrolling.Face{
        "small": {Atlas: smallAtlas, Metrics: smallMetrics},
        "large": {Atlas: largeAtlas, Metrics: largeMetrics},
    },
    Font: "small", Controls: scrolltext.Braces,
    Speed: 120, X: 800, Y: 300, Repeat: true, Gap: 80,
    Text: "HELLO {font:large}WORLD {speed:240}FAST {pause:1}{speed:120}AGAIN ",
})
```

Use `Controls: nil` for literal text. Register any number of independent fonts,
with their own ordering, cell sizes, advances, bearings, aliases and blank glyphs.
The built-in parser supports font, speed, pause, scale, tracking, shape and effect
controls. A custom decoder can retain original syntax or binary control payloads;
`scrolltext.DomSizes` implements the original `^CsN;` syntax.

`Scrolling.DrawAt` also accepts original positions, visible ranges, circular text
windows, reverse drawing order and a glyph mapper. This lets an existing demo keep
its exact tick counters and reset conditions while sharing the renderer. Shader
and animated-strip backends use `DrawState.Paint`, retaining the same iteration
and layout pipeline. See the scrolling guide.

## Compose effects without a prescribed layout

- `composite.Sprites`: configurable sprite/logo counts, frames, crops, transforms,
  drawing order and per-instance color/blend/filter options.
- `composite.Strips`: exact row/column sampling for scrollers, distorted logos and
  image-based rasters; source selection is independent of destination geometry.
- `composite.NewPass` / `Layer`: reusable surfaces, ordered deformation passes,
  clipping, transforms and blending around any effect.
- `composite.QuadBatch`: bounded triangle batches, explicit diagonal selection and
  optional Kage shaders/custom vertex attributes.
- `composite.Repeat`: repeating/rotozoom textures with explicit origin and color.
- `sprites.Projector`: shared vectorball projection, model matrix, image selection,
  camera conventions, depth ordering and optional perspective sprite scaling.
- `kit.Group` / `Sequence`: arbitrary layer order and local scene timing.

The full [composer example](examples/composer/main.go) demonstrates these choices.
The original demo applications contain the production-specific schedules and data.
Shared code handles rendering; artistic parameters are not replaced with defaults.

Additional packages provide bitmap metrics (`font`), curves/keyframes (`motion`),
geometry, palettes (`indexed`), vector font outlines (`outline`), asset loading,
and device-independent YM/go-zikmu PCM (`sound`). Use `sound/ebiten` with one
application-owned audio context. Existing production audio was preserved during
these visual migrations. Second Reality still uses its original ST3 synchronization;
its complete scene/audio extraction is not finished.

## Evidence and limits

**18 productions:** eight complete-frame comparisons each against the original
source revision, with **zero differing pixels** at the tested states (frames
0, 1, 60, 240, 600, 1200, 2400 and 4800). Rendering methods in these applications
actually call the shared kit. This is a component migration, not a claim that all
application code has moved into the library.

**Second Reality:** only indexed palette expansion has been shared and compared
across renderer modes using a VRAM fixture. This does **not** establish complete
scene extraction or musical synchronization through go-zikmu.

JSON reports identify the original and migrated commits in docs/fidelity.
The fidelity contract and coverage distinguish complete-frame
comparisons from the renderer-only case. Audio is disabled during captures and
wall-clock/random-seed inputs are fixed in temporary snapshots. PNG references,
candidates and differences are written to `captures/fidelity/` and are not bundled.

## Build and checks

Go 1.26+ is required. Ebitengine and audio versions remain pinned in `go.mod`.
Graphics tests require a native/virtual display.

```sh
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
go run ./cmd/checkassets -demos ../../demos
go run ./cmd/checkaudio -demos ../../demos
go run ./cmd/fidelity -demo grodan-kvack-kvack-demo
```

All 19 original repository test suites also pass after their migrations. See
validation details, source inventory,
migration notes and progress.
